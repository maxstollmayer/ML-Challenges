# Challenge 2: The freezing Fritz

Deadline: 07.05. 18:00 

Handed in: 07.05. ~14:00

## Solution

Our solution can be found in [Challenge-2-Notebook.ipynb](Challenge-2-Notebook.ipynb) and the predictions can be found in [ToTheMooners_prediction.csv.](ToTheMooners_prediction.csv)

In the jupyter notebook we documented our process, where we first analysed the data, explored some Regressors from the sklearn library and Variations of the Simple Regressor by Petersen. Finally we settled on the RandomForestRegressor since it gave the best results. Sadly we were not able to improve upon this by more sophisticated data analysis.

Feedback is highly appreciated!
