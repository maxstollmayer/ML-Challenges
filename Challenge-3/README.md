# Challenge 3: Facial Expression Classification

## Solution

Our solution can be found in [Challenge-3-Notebook.ipynb](Challenge-3-Notebook.ipynb) and the predictions can be found in [ToTheMooners_prediction.csv.](ToTheMooners_prediction.csv)

In the jupyter notebook we documented our process, where we did a ususal train-test-split and trained an image regressor with the automatic implementation of keras (called autokeras). This automatic implementation trained for several days to find the best hyperparameters in 100 tries with 1000 epochs for each try.

Feedback is highly appreciated!
